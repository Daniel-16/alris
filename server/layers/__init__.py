Alris Layered Architecture

This package organizes the Alris architecture into three distinct layers:

1. LangChain Agent Layer: The intelligent core that interprets and plans task execution
2. MCP Connector Layer: A bridge between agents and external services
3. External Services Layer: Components that execute tasks in the real world

Each layer has clear responsibilities and interfaces, promoting separation of concerns
and making the system more maintainable and extensible.
